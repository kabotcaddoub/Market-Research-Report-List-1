<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elastomeric Membrane Roofing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sheet</li><li>Liquid Applied</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Elastomeric membrane roofing encompasses two primary types: sheets and liquid-applied systems. Sheet membranes are pre-manufactured rolls of elastomeric material, typically used for their durability and ease of installation. They are often heat-welded or adhered to the roof surface, providing seamless protection. Liquid-applied membranes, on the other hand, are sprayed or brushed onto the roof, forming a continuous waterproof layer once cured. Both types offer UV resistance, flexibility, and energy efficiency, making them popular choices for various commercial and residential applications.</p></p>
