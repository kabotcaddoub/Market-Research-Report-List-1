<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Knee Arthroplasty Implant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Total Knee Arthroplasty Implant</li><li>Partial Knee Arthroplasty Implant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The knee arthroplasty implant market is primarily divided into two types: total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implants and partial knee arthroplasty (PKA) implants. TKA implants are designed to replace the entire knee joint, suitable for patients with extensive joint damage or arthritis. Conversely, PKA implants only replace a damaged compartment of the knee, which is less invasive and preserves more natural bone and tissue. Both types address pain relief and improved mobility but cater to different levels of joint deterioration.</p></p>
